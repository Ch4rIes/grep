# Mini Grep CLI Tool

Mini Grep is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its functionality is inspired by the traditional Unix grep command but focuses on simplicity and ease of use for beginners and experienced users alike.

## Features
- Regular Expression Support: Use powerful regular expressions to describe complex search patterns.
- Able to match for patterns such as Anchor, Alternation, Quantifiers and more!
